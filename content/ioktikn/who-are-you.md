*A poem*

I'm the writing on the walls
I'm nothing at all
I'm the ghost you keep on seeing
I'm the check you never cashed

I'm the thing you keep putting off
I'm the thing you keep on chasing
I'm the freckles on your face
I'm the wind blowing through your hair

I'm what makes you cry
I'm a figment of your imagination
I'm your worst nightmare
I'm a part of your salvation

I'm the one who got away
I'm the one who never left
I'm something you can't replace
I'm something we can't understand

I'm a sad creature that keeps worrying
I'm seven missed calls from your mom
I'm what's keeping you from falling apart
I'm why you give it your all

I'm the circuit in your spine
I'm two more things to say
I'm the eyes you didn't know you had
I'm the reason you should try
