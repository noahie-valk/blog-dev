Today is just another day, really. I don't have a whole lot on my mind at this present moment, but I feel compelled to write to not only keep up my habit and get all of my metaphysical
gunk out, but also because I still want to feel the novelty of my new workflow. Now that I have Cogtio hosted here on my site, I have a new workflow. When I was keeping the diary private,
I just had a large document in LibreOffice Writer, but now that I'm pushing everything to the site, I decided to use my text editor of choice, nano. To me, nano is like the more normal
cousin compared to guys like emacs or vim. It's a lot simpler, too. For a while, it was a bit of a learning curve to get more used to the keyboard-centric controls, but now that I'm used
to them, there's no going back. At this point, I try to limit the use of my mouse as much as possible because of how much more efficient and painless keyboard use is. Constantly switching
between keyboard and mouse is a pain, but with my adoption of new software, I feel more efficient in how I use my computer. It's a world I had never explored before, and I'm surprised I 
didn't come into contact with it sooner. I remember the days where most of my technology use was with my iPhone and I remember actively thinking thoughts like "why would I need a computer?
I can do everything I need on my phone." But now I realize just how ignorant that thinking was. I also remember from about 2016 to 2023, I didn't even own a computer. I just did everything
on my phone. At that time I was in college, and if I ever really needed a computer, I'd just go to the library and borrow one of theirs. Even that was seldom done, though. For what I was
doing with my life at the time, I just didn't need a computer. 

But now that life is different for me, I understand just how much better a computer is for me with regards to my technology use. Most computing these days is done on the web browser, and 
the web browsing experience is way better on a computer. I also just detest how much everyone constantly wants an app on their phone for everything. The irony though is that most of the
major apps that people use are just web apps anyway, so there's not really much of a difference compared to just using a web browser. I remember back when I used to use Facebook, I had the 
app on my phone but it was a total drain on my battery. Then I figured out that if I just used my phone's web browser and used Facebook there, it saved a lot more battery. It's just crazy
to me that Javascript will end up replacing everything one day. It seems that the whole fucking world runs on Javascript. But anyways, I appreciate the fact that I have options and can 
figure things out my way. For as much as people like to complain about America or the Western world or whatever, I feel that people take certain degrees of their peace and freedom for 
granted. At least here in America, most people don't understand just how much better off they are than the rest of the world. This is why I always hate it when rich people in Hollywood or
whatever try to complain about the political system or whatever. The irony is just rich to me. First of all, they are the single biggest benefactors of that system, so their complaints are
completely unjustified. And second, their complaints aren't even valid. To me, it just feels like a fruitless and pitiful attempt to try and humanize or moralize people who spend their 
whole lives and careers banking on elevating themselves about humanity and morality. It's very much giving "Let them eat cake."

One thing I constantly reflect on is the nature of power with regards to how I feel about it compared to the right way to act about it. I just mean that on the one hand, I see oppressive
and stupid forces at play constantly and my gut instinct has always been to try and resist or attempt to dismantle those forces in some way. However, I also understand that Christian 
teaching opposes that attitude and offers a different perspective. Instead of trying to rebel against these forces that govern us, it's important instead to try and be apart of them and to 
not get in their way because whether we like it or not, God put those forces and people in charge for a reason. It's never a good idea to question God's sovereignty, so it's better to be
faithful and understand that there's a bigger plan in action that we as individuals might not readily see. I mean, Paul was saying that in the epistle to the Romans during the time of Caesar
so if he can say that during one of the most oppressive and tyrannical regimes in history, then I can say that today. I might not like how the shitty governments and corporations do things,
but I also know that it's more important to have faith in God's timing and actions and to not rely on my own limited judgment. In this instance, it's more practical and comforting to take a
step back and say "I don't know" and to just let the chips fall as they may. Even if it brings a lot more pain in the moment to do that, the reasoning will be revealed in due time.
