This is my diary. I do a lot of philosophizing and meta-cognitive BS whenever I write in my diary, so I decided to call it Cogito because in Latin it means "I think" and is essentially the first half of one of philosophy's most famous phrases *Cogito ergo sum* which means "I think, therefore I am." 

This practice has been a source of solace for me. Life is hard in a lot of ways, and being able to write it all down has been very helpful for me emotionally.
