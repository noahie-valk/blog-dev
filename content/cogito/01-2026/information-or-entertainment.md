I've been a casual user of the [Melonland forum](https://forum.melonland.net) for a while now. I first made an account back when I launched this site in February of last year. Melon has done a great job running his forum. His art and software projects are always a pleasure to engage with. Also, he got interviewed by [Rhizome](https://rhizome.org/editorial/2025/jul/29/artist-profile-daniel-murray/) and that made me kind of jelly. Recently, I followed the RSS feed for the forum, which has made it easier to keep up. I never really posted on forums when I was younger, but it's been a fun experience getting to know this one. 

I responded to [a post](https://forum.melonland.net/index.php?topic=2136.msg49580#msg49580) earlier today and it really got me reflecting on my journey writing online over the last two years or so. It's been quite the experience, that's for sure. I remember when I first started, I called myself a "freelance writer." I thought that it was a grand dream to get paid to write. It was enticing. Unfortunately, I learned quickly that the space is much more competitive and saturated than I thought. It turned out that a ton of people had the same idea as me. Go figure. With the advent of LLMs, it made the space even more competitive since there were now fewer jobs.

I found a guy who was a professional copywriter back in early 2024. His website was impressive and he seemed to have a lot of experience. I sent him an email soliciting advice on how to get into the industry. His reply was harrowing. He said that he lost most of his clients because they had a better experience with ChatGPT because they could get results quicker and cheaper. He was forced to transition to resume writing and told me that I wasn't going to find any work in copywriting. 

Around that time, I posted some ads on different websites to promote my services. Conventional advice was to pick a niche, usually something you were interested in and knew a lot about. People can write about beauty, tech, dogs, cats, or whatever else. I considered picking music as my niche, but decided instead to go against conventional advice and become a generalist. I offered writing and editing. I got one consistent client and a few one-offs over the course of a few months, but quickly became dissatisfied with the work. 

The pay was shit, it was competitive, and it was *boring*. 

I realized quickly that I wanted to write things that actually interested me and I wanted more control over my platform. That's when I discovered Substack and decided to have a go at becoming a newsletter merchant. I found that it was tough to figure out what I wanted to write about. I couldn't get past myself, and ended up publishing things that were subpar. Moreover, I wasn't publishing frequently enough to get favored by the algorithm. Soon enough, I felt like I was at a dead end. I couldn't pull in any readers. The only people subscribed to me were ones I knew personally. My work wasn't getting on anyone's feeds. Promotion felt impossible. It was bullshit.

On top of that, I felt like I wasn't going anywhere. To write as a career, I now know, is a pipe dream. Talent and hard work aren't enough. You also have to sacrifice your values, denigrate yourself, and if you're *lucky*, you might be able to make a living as a second-rate hack. I used to aspire to be a guy like Hemingway, Dickens, or even Faulkner. I wished that my words were good enough to get printed and into people's hands. I understand now that it's more realistic to be like Bukowski, working a regular job and having the books just be a side thing. Of course, Bukowski's main passion was writing, but the hard lesson is that passion rarely pays the bills. 

I'm conflicted about whether I even want to make a living with my writing. Seeing the popular Substack publications was a sobering experience. The writing was devoid of *soul*. I've learned that when it comes to reading, there are two reasons why people read anything. 

Information and entertainment. 

Those are the only two reasons why anyone reads *anything*. I'm at a position now where I have to ask myself, do I wish to perform? Am I informative? Do I have any business being persuasive? Is Cogito meant to entertain? I guess it's time for me to have my Maximus moment.

Are you not entertained?
