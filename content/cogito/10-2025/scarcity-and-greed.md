This morning I find myself thinking yet again about the illusion of scarcity. It's difficult to dispel to others what exactly this means. *How is scarcity an illusion? Isn't it clear that there's not enough to go around?* Many see scarcity as reality due to historical and personal factors. Whether it's the fact that humanity has gone through many bouts of pestilence and famine or the constant reminder that there are only two dozen hours in a day, we have a strong notion to treat every aspect of life as though it were in limited supply. This notion breeds selfishness, greed, and pride. 

But the truth is that there's always been enough to go around; we've lacked only the faith to accept it. Now, it's easy to conflate that declaration with new-age-eastern-adjacent-law-of-attraction-but-still-secular thinking, but this knowledge runs deeper than rudimentary manifestation and solipsism. There are forces at play that want us to forget the abundance that surrounds every aspect of our lives. These forces aim to distort our thinking and force the false belief of scarcity so that we see generosity as weakness and greed as strength.

Now, our current pro-rationalist dialectic paradigm would expect me to carry the burden of bringing in some kind of empirical basis for these assertions, but there really is no need for me to do that. I have the dogma of the church to back me up. 

People have grown fearful of dogma, and this is for a good reason: we've seen the rise of authoritarianism in our globalized society and moreover, we've seen how these incumbent regimes misuse their influence to promote the selfishness, greed, and pride that I am trying to admonish. Another truth: people are far more accepting of dogma than they'd wish to admit. Herd mentality exists for a reason; people like being told what to do. Uncertainty establishes the inability to ascertain any kind of future. 

This reality is the root of anxiety. Because of this anxiety, people find themselves turning to dogma. This dogma can be found in religious and secular institutions alike. The unfortunate reality I see, however, is that people would rather worship the Federal Reserve than the Lord their God. And here's the kicker: the Fed warns of scarcity and liquidity, but Christ tells us that there will always be a cup to drink from. 

I'll leave you with this: don't let the myopia of humanity's institutions keep you from indulging in God's generous gifts. There's more for you in store than we could ever dream of.
