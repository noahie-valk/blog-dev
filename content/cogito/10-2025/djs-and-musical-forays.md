I've recently been listening to a bunch of really awesome DJ sets. I listened to that new Skrillex album and not a single track misses. For my workouts, I find that I can put on a new DJ set and listen to it the whole way through while on the treadmill, elliptical, or stationary bike. It takes me to a whole different world. These DJ sets in conjunction with the Internet radio aspirations really have my gears turning. As a saxophone player, I think it would be the greatest thing ever if I could learn how to be a DJ and instead of having a keyboard like most DJs, I have an EWI instead. That shit would be insane. I haven't seen many musicians incorporate EWI into their repertoire. The only one I saw who really did it at the highest level was Michael Brecker and that was decades ago. If there were a DJ who could play EWI, that would be peak music, full stop. 

These sets I've been listening to have filled a huge pool of emotion and inspiration for me. The command that these DJs have over a room is as intoxicating as it is enticing. It's a space I would love to take if I worked towards it. All I'd need is an EWI and a laptop—everything else would fall right into place. I haven't been able to attend many live EDM shows because they have a lot of flashing lights and those give me seizures, but seeing sets like Fred Again on the rooftops gives me confidence that there's so much more to that world than I know.

While I'd love to jump head first into something like that, I still have other things on my plate. I want to write as much as I can. I want to work out as much as I can. It truly does feel like there's not enough time in the day for all of the things I'd like to do. At the same time, though, I know that I spend too much time reading blogs and books and all that, so maybe if I switched my focus over from that to music aspirations, I wouldn't feel as crunched for time. Man, the writer/musician combo truly is the hardest one of all time. I want to let my art shine so badly. It seems that given the course of events in my life, the path of the artist is the only one that has illuminated for me. Everything else feels like too much of a struggle; anything else would most likely end in an early death for me.

Writer.

I am a writer.

But I better write fast, 'cause my paper's on fire.
