I'm starting off today's entry a little bit later than normal (for me, anyway) because I had some family come by and visit (hey to y'all if you're reading!) and before that was answering some messages. But here I am again, ready to write about all of the things that have been on my mind. 

I thought that I was getting depressed again, but somehow it decided to not rear its head this time. Strangely enough, I rarely get those kinds of reprieves. It seems that my lifestyle changes have been helping to a certain degree, so that's good. I'm thankful that the systems I've cultivated are returning some kind of dividends. Maybe if things stay on this course, I can really begin to grow into the person God wants me to be. This'll take a bit more time to truly feel substantiated though, and historically I haven't been that lucky, but life can be funny in that way. All of this suffering I've been through can one day be channeled into something beautiful, but I have to be patient and let the proverbial iron heat up a bit more, I think.

A fun thing: I found another internet radio station, [asahidenpa](https://asahidenpa.neocities.org) and these guys are the exact vibe I want to cultivate. Also, their tech stack looks extremely reasonable and I will most likely take inspiration from that once my own radio station comes about. The main thing that I've been needing to do: I need to get a huge set list of songs before I start. The thing with it, though, is that I don't want to play typical music one has typically heard. I want the deepest of the deepest cuts, stuff that gets barely any traction of any kind. 

There are two reasons for this. First, those artists deserve the recognition, full stop. Second, that kind of music wouldn't have any legal tape around it, so I wouldn't have to worry about paying any kind of royalty or anything like that. I feel that for my situation, this is in line with my ethos. My work here is under a Creative Commons license, so my hope is to spread that ethos with artists I may find when searching for music.

Something that I've seen other internet radio stations do is they try to have tons of different DJs take on different time segments for different shows, but I think that I'd prefer to be a one-man show. The idea would be this: have a 24/7 auto DJ playing different songs from a massive playlist, put in different bumpers that I make every few songs, and during times when I find most appropriate, I can hop in and have shows of my own. I'd love to not only have the auto-DJ, but also live mixing and talk segments as well. 

One of my friends showed me [Redbar](https://redbarradio.net) and the idea of having streams last over multiple hours sounds like it would be fun, except I'd like to have them over my own radio station. I don't feel the most comfortable having video streams like how Redbar does it, but having an audio-only one with music and talking in between sounds like it would be super engaging and fun. 

I have no idea where any of this would even go or even if it would go anywhere at all, but I'm not afraid to try.
