Man, yesterday was such a long day. After dealing with the long delayed flight, taking the delayed bus to the hotel, and having the rehearsal and the rehearsal dinner all after doing an all-nighter the night before, I *crashed* into bed at around 9 PM after taking a well-deserved shower (I was so sweaty the whole day, man) and was asleep for a nice 11 hours. After getting ready this morning, I felt that now would be a good time to get today's entry in before I have to start doing stuff for the wedding. I have a good chunk of my morning free, so I'm going to spend it here in the comfort of my hotel room so that I can continue to decompress from everything. 

Last night at the rehearsal dinner, I was expected to make a speech for the bride and groom. I had been told that I was going to make this speech months in advance, yet I couldn't think of a single thing to say in all that preparation time. So instead of freaking out about it, I resolved to just go off the cuff and say it from the heart. I have some public speaking experience, well, not a ton. But I felt comfortable enough in front of everyone to just say what was on my mind. I had one or two anecdotes lined up in my head that I knew would land well, and then the rest was just a matter of divine inspiration. Seriously, I just turned my brain off and let my mouth do all the work.

So today is the wedding and it's going to be an all-day affair, of course. I have my suit ready and now it's just a matter of not letting it get destroyed between now and the ceremony—should be easy enough. I feel a lot more comfortable about it today than I did last night because I now actually have gotten some sleep, but it's just going to be a busy day with a lot of socializing and doing stuff.

I've gotten a lot less tolerant of socializing. Perhaps I could say that my social battery has gotten weaker, but I think that more than anything it's just gotten less tolerant of meandering. For me, I want to socialize the best way I know how: all killer, no filler. I don't like to mince words or pretend about anything, so I try to avoid niceties and pleasantries and other things that obfuscate the direct line of communication. Most communication is non-verbal anyway, so speech is really just icing on the cake, so to speak. People have always been good at talking not *at* each other, but *past* each other. There's always subtext to read in a social situation, things to notice, that kind of thing. 

But I have a feeling that a lot of people spend a lot of time in their heads when socializing, reading all that subtext and so on. I don't really want to get deep into any kind of social psychology because I really don't like that kind of stuff. I also don't really like meta-socializing either. Like, when people talk about the social situation directly instead of just being in the social situation is a bit of an annoying thing for me. 

Today won't involve any of that, though. It'll be a good day.
