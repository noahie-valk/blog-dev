Today has been a nice enough day so far that I have decided to spend my time writing today outside. We finally are over the long hump of the late spring, summer, and early fall heat. Now we are in the half of the year that is actually pleasant, which is always a blessing. I returned my suit rental today and I was a day late, but was fortunate enough to get the late fee waived by the woman checking the suit back in. I wish I could appreciate those nice little things more in the moment. I'll probably forget about that small bit of mercy in a week—what a nice guy I am, right?

Right now it's not super hot, but I still am a bit hot and sweaty. I have always been a sweaty guy and if the place that I'm in isn't cold, I'll sweat. That's just how it is. Especially in the aforementioned long hump season, I always have to be near a fan when sitting or laying still in a single place; otherwise I will sweat and get disgusting rather quickly. I have to always make sure that I'm changing my clothes regularly and oftentimes I'll wear two shirts in a day because of how sweaty I get. Putting on a fresh clean shirt after wiping off your sweaty torso with a towel is always a pleasant sensation, so maybe being sweaty is more of a blessing than I care to admit to myself.

Like I've mentioned in [previous entries](https://noahie.xyz/cogito/10-2025/advertising-irony-and-internet-radio), I still want to start my own internet radio station and now that I have a few weeks of free time coming up, I'm hoping to get that off the ground this month. I still have to curate and download a music collection. Whoops. I could've been doing that earlier, but I have just been putting the whole thing off because I have a vision for it in my head that I want to pull off, but there's just been a lot that I want to still think through I guess. Well, there's also all the coding and other stuff I'll have to do to set it up and that's always a pain in the ass. Oh well, such is life. 

I really need to find something for my anxiety. I used to take 30 mg of buspirone and that didn't really help too much. More than likely I'll start taking CBD since I know that helps a lot of people and I've had good results with it before. I've always tried taking CBD on and off, but never got consistent with it. I'm not too sure why. I'll probably just start including a capsule dosage with my morning supplement routine. I already take a bunch of stuff, but it's fine. It's not horribly expensive and I'd much rather take a bunch of supplements than psychiatric medications. 

Today is just another day. Another day, and maybe even another one after that.
