A few months back, I discovered the idea of [chaos magick](https://noahie.xyz/blog/cogito/11-2025/reality-and-chaos-magick) and have been thinking about it a lot in spurts since then. In chaos magick, the main idea behind it is that one can effectuate change in certain domains of the world based on the craft and meditation of sigils. Sigils are symbols that embody the change you want to take place. What makes chaos magick unique from other forms of magic is the idea that there are no inherent rules behind making a sigil, so anyone who can draw one has the ability to practice whatever form of magic they know and can incorporate different schools of thought into a single sigil and individualized practice. The thought I've had that's fascinated me is this:

All words, when written down, are sigils.

I remember seeing [this video from Alan Moore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oan10yp5pQ) where he discussed practical advice given to magicians that also applies to aspiring writers. As I stated in that previous post on chaos magick, I believe that as a writer, I have the ability to put thoughts into people's heads, make the thoughts more real, and turn that into some kind of real-world impact. This, of course, is literally magic. With an unprecedented level of literacy throughout most of the world, we've seen levels of magic that are equally as unprecedented. It is as amazing as it is horrifying.

Most people who are literate don't typically ponder the powers that they have within them. Instead, what we see is a constant battle for their attention from all different kinds of places. This is literally energy harvesting on a spiritual level. If people only knew how valuable they were, the world might look a lot different. Of course, this power doesn't come from nowhere. All this power that we have to effectuate change through transmitting messages through words and language comes, to me at least, directly from divine sources.

I think of things at church like the Divine Liturgy, hesychastic practices, or writings from the saints, and I realize that magic is right along the same lines as those things. This is why, ultimately, it's dangerous. The second we try to think that spiritual power comes anywhere else than the Lord Jesus Christ, we lose our grip with our own personal spiritual power immediately and become victims of demonic influence. All of the occult rumors, practices, and rituals are in direct conflict with our salvation. They are misguided spirits that have to be cast out.

I've been doing well in life since I started Cogito, and I think that's due largely to the spiritual channeling that comes with this practice. Every entry here is its own sigil and becomes charged by spreading it to those who wish to read it. But my intentions with these sigils are benevolent, as I've made clear many times before. However, I need to check with myself and make sure that my understanding of the power I hold here is in line with divine intellect. My whole pursuit here is one meant to change hearts through showing a direct connection to Christ and to strengthen my case for salvation. Anything else that might come of it is either inconsequential or, worse, a temptation of some kind.

I hope I don't come off as utterly unhinged with these kinds of confessions here. Ultimately, the ideas that I'm espousing here are complex abstractions and difficult to parse through. But that's also why I'm here writing them down. Through this constant act of exploration, I hope to unlock a uniquely good and powerful force that helps the world in some way. It might come off as grandiose, but like I said earlier, most people aren't aware of this latent power they have. For some reason or another, I've come to this line of thought and discovered this important truth, and so now it's my responsibility to channel that truth into something that can help someone.

Truthfully, I've become more paranoid as of late. Thankfully, it's not in a completely manic or delusional way, but I would be lying if I said it wasn't derived from that state of mind. Considering how deep I've been in it before, this is nothing; if anything, it's more lucid. It's as if I can see the writing on the walls but can't do much more. This paranoia manifests itself in ideas that are tangible and real: the surveillance state, [cognitive warfare](https://noahie.xyz/blog/cogito/02-2026/cognitive-warfare), and geopolitical tensions. However, the thing I try to remember to keep myself grounded is my position within those things. I might discuss the latent powers of myself or anyone else, but those things are ultimately a lot more mundane than a state of delusional mania would try to make me think.

Still, I have these little glimpses of things. Simple coincidences don't feel so simple. New people that come into my life raise suspicions. The world feels not quite normal—its hues are just a bit more saturated. I hope that as I write through these saturated hues, I can give myself the comfort of knowing that I'm safe. I know that regardless of whether or not I wake up tomorrow, the world will keep spinning.

Let it spin, then.
