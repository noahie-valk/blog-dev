I went over to a friend's house today and played around with his new 3D printer. We mostly perused directories with free design files. But we did get to print a few designs that looked pretty cool. I got to walk away with a few souvenirs, too. My friend printed a stand for his headphones but they didn't fit. I put mine on the stand to see if they'd fit and they fit like a glove, so he let me take it home and it looks awesome on my desk. It was a fun day. We both looked a bit more into the 3D modeling program Blender and it's a rather extensive program with a steep learning curve, but nonetheless it was fun dipping my toes into it.

Doing the 3D printer stuff got me thinking more about career options with CAD and things like that. I mentioned previously that I was considering figuring out what it would take to become a CNC machinist, and hanging out with my friend today is making that itch come back. It seems like it would be a cool, practical, and fun job. I don't know a whole lot about it, but I'll just have to figure it out sooner or later. 

For me, the big thing that worries me about considering a new career is the fear of starting, hitting a bump in the road, and quitting. I can do that a lot. 

I'm super tired after a long day, so I'll cut things short today.

Thank you, lovely reader. Have a great day.
