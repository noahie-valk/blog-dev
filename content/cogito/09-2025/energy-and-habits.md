I woke up this morning feeling a lot more rested, which is nice. It seems that I was actually able to get decent rest last night, so I feel much more able to get stuff done today. I want to build more onto this blog like I've been planning on doing. I have the code built for giving my posts tags, so I'll probably work on going back into this corpus and adding tags to each of my different posts. I'll also try to do some backlinking to give more of that jump-around feel I'm hoping to achieve. Funny enough, I don't really consider myself too much of a non-linear thinker when it comes to organization of information and organization in general. I really enjoy the tree system when it comes to organizing directories. I remember when I tried Obsidian for a while, I was unconvinced of the linking system that it provided. I couldn't find any demonstrable sort of purpose for me to make those links and have that graph or whatever. For me, I found that the file system already built-in to my computer was good enough for me. 

I still enjoy a good Wikipedia deep dive though, so I feel it would be best to give my site that kind of feel because I think that kind of way of reading is something that resonates most with me and I want my work to reflect my own enjoyment of that kind of reading process. I enjoy reading quite a bit and find it much better than film media. I don't really enjoy watching TV shows or movies. I don't even watch YouTube videos hardly at all anymore. I think that as I've aged and gone through life, I've come to see that film media is genuinely a sensory overload for me now. I think also for my own personal sense of mental stability, it's probably best for me not to engage in it because I've felt the hyperreality of film media creep into my psyche and it's gotten harder for me to keep a solid basis of reality when watching too much film media. Overall, the less I watch any kind of video, the better. I can still read and listen to music without this kind of problem, so I lean onto those mediums more. Fuck audio books, though. 

I'm looking forward to seeing what else I can work on and get done today now that I don't feel as fatigued as I have the rest of this week. I also love writing when I feel well-rested. It feels like the brain pipes are less clogged, which is nice. I don't really have any big ideas I've been thinking on since the last entry, so at this point I'm writing just the exact thoughts on my mind with no prior curating or planning. I think that if I keep writing, something will come up. No judgments here, just writing. I feel compelled to type and type until my timer goes off and fill in this space with the present moment. In that way, it is a meditation of sorts, and I think that's pretty cool. I think it's nice to have the space for this, and maybe something good will come out of it.

I can write for an uninterrupted 20 minutes at a time, full send, with a decent amount of ease. I think that with writing, it's best to work in these short bursts and get better at producing work over time because short consistent bursts are more efficient and sustainable than a few long and substantiated bursts over a long period of time. The consistency, the "grind," is what helps us improve at skills and other endeavors. There's an adage that's gone around saying that it takes three weeks of doing something every day to make it a habit, but truthfully three weeks is nowhere near enough time. I'd say it's more like six months, given my personal experience. I'm two months nicotine-free, but I know that smoking as a habit is still wired in me. I still get cravings, but over time they've gotten easier to manage. It'll take a lot longer for my body to forget the sensation of nicotine, but I know that once it does, I'll hardly think about smoking at all. 

So with my writing, I just need to keep building and working so that I can do these uninterrupted bursts for longer periods over more days and soon enough, I'll build exactly what I've been intending to build this whole time.
