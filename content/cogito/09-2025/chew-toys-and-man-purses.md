I am back at the Starbucks, big chilling and feeling good after trying that new protein foam stuff. I don't shill for Starbucks (or anyone else) but having the extra protein in my little drink helps me with staving off pre-dinner hunger. Anyways, I am off to my sprint and in the sprint spirit, I am trying to keep things directly off the top of my head here. I got a chew toy like the dog I am. No, seriously, I got one of those chew toys that are marketed towards little kids with autism. Here's the thing: I got it because I used Jolly Ranchers to quit my nicotine addiction, but then I got addicted to Jolly Ranchers. So to limit my Jolly Rancher consumption (they are very bad for your teeth), I decided to get a little chew toy so that I could stave off the Jolly Ranchers now that the nicotine is more or less functionally out of my body. 

It feels pretty nice to use it. I got it as a little necklace and keep it in my mouth whenever the bad thoughts come into my head (they do it a lot), so it's a nice little grounding tool in that respect as well.

Oh, I also got a man purse. I'm not even kidding; I got an actual man purse. Well, the non-gay term is cross-body bag, but it is functionally and aesthetically a man purse. Let me tell you, formless and shapeless reader: it is the ultimate move, seriously. See, I hate pockets because I have too much stuff. Women complain needlessly about their pants not having pockets. Sis, let me tell you that you do *not* need them, okay? The purse is the essential. See, the cynical marketing teams of times past marketed different things for men like backpacks or briefcases or whatever, but a *BAG* with a *STRAP* is the peak form and function for carrying personal items when out and about. Listen, if you're not *PURSED UP*, get the hell out of my house.

So yeah, that's what I got recently that's been helping me stave through the coprophagic tempest we like to call life. At this point, I still feel like I am in a "building" sort of phase. There has been a lot of, I guess, 'fundamental' things that I've had to work through over the last few years, but I feel that I have sufficiently reached a new culmination of this work. Let me tell you, it was long, dirty, and wretched work. But thankfully, I believe that I've put myself in a position where I have gone through the hardest parts of that—dealing with mental illness is tough for anyone, but I think that with all of the different cultural shifts that global society had to face—that made it all the more exacerbated for me. 

But today is not a day of lamentation or crying or whining or grieving or some other sad thing. Today is a good day; it is a normal day. And because of that, I'd like to take the time to stop and actually give those roses a smell. By the way, I have this little spray bottle of cologne I keep in my man purse and I sprayed it before coming to the Starbucks. It has a rather strong smell. I don't know how people perceive that—well, in the sense of its strength. Is it too strong? I like colognes or perfumes when they're subtle but this doesn't feel subtle. Oh well, it doesn't matter. 

Okay partners, we are done for today. Stay loved.
